# Web-Scrapping

The code contains the script to let you search anything through google using the command line and the top 5 search results will be stored
in the database.
After storing the data, the last 4 lines of code will display the data stored in the database.
Here I have used MongoDB as my NOSQL database.
BeautifulSoup4 library has been used to pull out data from the HTML.
